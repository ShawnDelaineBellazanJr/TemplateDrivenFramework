# Workflow System Documentation

## Overview

The workflow system implements Microsoft Semantic Kernel's **Process Framework** to provide event-driven, stateful workflow execution. This system enables complex multi-step processes with dynamic branching, parallel execution, and context preservation across steps.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Process Framework Integration
- **Event-Driven Execution**: Steps communicate via events rather than direct calls
- **Stateful Workflows**: Automatic checkpointing and state preservation
- **Dynamic Branching**: Conditional flows, loops, and parallel execution
- **Context Flow**: Rich context passing between workflow steps

### 2. Workflow Patterns
- **Sequential**: Linear step-by-step execution
- **Parallel**: Concurrent step execution
- **Conditional**: Dynamic branching based on conditions
- **Looping**: Iterative execution with termination conditions

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Process Engine
The core component that orchestrates workflow execution:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.framework/v1
kind: ProcessEngine
metadata:
  name: process-engine
spec:
  executionMode: "event-driven"
  stateManagement:
    type: "checkpointing"
    interval: "30s"
    persistence: "database"
  
  eventBus:
    type: "in-memory"
    maxConcurrency: 100
    retryPolicy:
      maxAttempts: 3
      backoff: "exponential"
  
  monitoring:
    metrics: true
    tracing: true
    logging: "structured"
```

### 2. Process Definition
Workflows are defined using the Process Framework:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.framework/v1
kind: Process
metadata:
  name: context-evolution-workflow
  version: 1.0.0
spec:
  pattern: "sequential"
  steps:
    - name: "planner-step"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "planner-agent"
      input: "{{context}}"
      output: "plan"
      events:
        - name: "plan-completed"
          condition: "success"
        - name: "plan-failed"
          condition: "error"
    
    - name: "maker-step"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "maker-agent"
      input: "{{plan}}"
      output: "result"
      events:
        - name: "execution-completed"
          condition: "success"
        - name: "execution-failed"
          condition: "error"
    
    - name: "checker-step"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "checker-agent"
      input: "{{result}}"
      output: "validation"
      events:
        - name: "validation-completed"
          condition: "success"
        - name: "validation-failed"
          condition: "error"
    
    - name: "reflector-step"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "reflector-agent"
      input: "{{validation}}"
      output: "evolved-context"
      events:
        - name: "reflection-completed"
          condition: "success"
        - name: "reflection-failed"
          condition: "error"
  
  contextFlow:
    - from: "input"
      to: "planner-step"
    - from: "planner-step"
      to: "maker-step"
    - from: "maker-step"
      to: "checker-step"
    - from: "checker-step"
      to: "reflector-step"
    - from: "reflector-step"
      to: "output"
  
  errorHandling:
    - step: "planner-step"
      onError: "retry"
      maxRetries: 3
    - step: "maker-step"
      onError: "fallback"
      fallback: "simple-maker"
    - step: "checker-step"
      onError: "continue"
    - step: "reflector-step"
      onError: "abort"
```

## Step Types

### 1. Agent Steps
Execute AI agents with specific roles:

```yaml

  name: agent-step
spec:
  type: "agent"
  implementation:
    class: "AgentProcessStep"
    configuration:
      model: "gpt-4"
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 2000
  
  inputSchema:
    type: "object"
    properties:
      context: { type: "object" }
      agent: { type: "string" }
      parameters: { type: "object" }
  
  outputSchema:
    type: "object"
    properties:
      result: { type: "object" }
      confidence: { type: "number" }
      metadata: { type: "object" }
  
  events:
    - name: "step-started"
      data: ["stepName", "input"]

    properties:
      processedData: { type: "object" }
      statistics: { type: "object" }
      errors: { type: "array" }
```

### 3. Integration Steps

    properties:
      data: { type: "object" }
      affectedRows: { type: "number" }
      executionTime: { type: "number" }
```

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Pattern
Linear execution of steps:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.framework/v1
kind: WorkflowPattern
metadata:
  name: sequential-pattern
spec:
  type: "sequential"
  steps:
    - name: "step-1"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-1"
    - name: "step-2"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-2"
    - name: "step-3"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-3"
  
  flow:
    - from: "step-1"
      to: "step-2"
      condition: "success"
    - from: "step-2"
      to: "step-3"
      condition: "success"
```

### 2. Parallel Pattern
Concurrent execution of steps:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.framework/v1
kind: WorkflowPattern
metadata:
  name: parallel-pattern
spec:
  type: "parallel"
  steps:
    - name: "parallel-step-1"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-1"
    - name: "parallel-step-2"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-2"
    - name: "parallel-step-3"
      type: "agent-step"
      agent: "agent-3"
  
  synchronization:
    type: "all-complete"
    aggregation:
      agent: "synthesis-agent"
      input: "{{parallel-step-1}}, {{parallel-step-2}}, {{parallel-step-3}}"
      output: "synthesized-result"
```

### 3. Conditional Pattern
Dynamic branching based on conditions:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.framework/v1
kind: WorkflowPattern
metadata:
  name: conditional-pattern
spec:
  type: "conditional"
  router:
    name: "router-step"
    type: "router-agent"
    input: "{{context}}"
    output: "routing-decision"
  
  branches:
    - name: "branch-a"
      condition: "{{routing-decision}} == 'branch-a'"
      steps:
        - name: "branch-a-step-1"
          type: "agent-step"
          agent: "branch-a-agent"
    
    - name: "branch-b"
      condition: "{{routing-decision}} == 'branch-b'"
      steps:
        - name: "branch-b-step-1"
          type: "agent-step"
          agent: "branch-b-agent"
    
    - name: "default"
      condition: "default"
      steps:
        - name: "default-step-1"
          type: "agent-step"
          agent: "default-agent"
```

## Context Management

### 1. Context Schema
Rich context object that flows through workflows:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "workflowId": { "type": "string" },
    "executionId": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string" },
    "input": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Original workflow input"
    },
    "currentState": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Current workflow state"
    },
    "stepHistory": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "stepName": { "type": "string" },
          "startTime": { "type": "string" },
          "endTime": { "type": "string" },
          "status": { "type": "string" },
          "input": { "type": "object" },
          "output": { "type": "object" },
          "error": { "type": "object" }
        }
      }
    },
    "variables": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Workflow variables"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Additional metadata"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Context Flow
How context evolves through workflow execution:

```yaml
contextFlow:
  - stage: "initialization"
    context: "input-context"
    description: "Initial context with input data"
  
  - stage: "step-execution"
    context: "step-context"
    description: "Context enhanced with step results"
  
  - stage: "aggregation"
    context: "aggregated-context"
    description: "Context with all step results combined"
  
  - stage: "finalization"
    context: "final-context"
    description: "Final context with workflow results"
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Error Strategies
Different approaches to handle workflow errors:

```yaml
errorHandling:
  strategies:
    - name: "retry"
      description: "Retry failed steps"
      configuration:
        maxRetries: 3
        backoff: "exponential"
        timeout: "60s"
    
    - name: "fallback"
      description: "Use alternative implementation"
      configuration:
        fallbackStep: "alternative-step"
        condition: "error"
    
    - name: "continue"
      description: "Continue with next step"
      configuration:
        logError: true
        skipStep: true
    
    - name: "abort"
      description: "Stop workflow execution"
      configuration:
        cleanup: true
        notification: true
```

### 2. Error Recovery
Recovery mechanisms for failed workflows:

```yaml
errorRecovery:
  - trigger: "workflow-failed"
    action: "checkpoint-restore"
    configuration:
      checkpoint: "last-successful"
      validation: true
  
  - trigger: "step-failed"
    action: "step-retry"
    configuration:
      maxAttempts: 3
      delay: "5s"
  
  - trigger: "timeout"
    action: "workflow-cancel"
    configuration:
      cleanup: true
      notification: true
```

## Performance and Monitoring

### 1. Workflow Metrics
Track workflow performance and health:

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: "workflow-execution-time"
    type: "duration"
    description: "Total workflow execution time"
  
  - name: "step-execution-time"
    type: "duration"
    description: "Individual step execution time"
  
  - name: "workflow-success-rate"
    type: "percentage"
    description: "Workflow success rate"
  
  - name: "step-success-rate"
    type: "percentage"
    description: "Individual step success rate"
  
  - name: "concurrent-workflows"
    type: "count"
    description: "Number of concurrent workflows"
```

### 2. Health Monitoring
Monitor workflow system health:

```yaml
healthChecks:
  - name: "process-engine-health"
    type: "ping"
    interval: "30s"
    timeout: "5s"
  
  - name: "event-bus-health"
    type: "connection-test"
    interval: "60s"
    timeout: "10s"
  
  - name: "step-execution-health"
    type: "performance-check"
    interval: "5m"
    threshold: "5s"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each step should have one clear purpose
- **Stateless Steps**: Steps should not maintain internal state
- **Context-Driven**: All behavior should be driven by context
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for each step

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Use parallel patterns when possible
- **Step Optimization**: Optimize individual step performance
- **Resource Management**: Manage computational resources efficiently
- **Caching**: Cache frequently used data and results

### 3. Monitoring and Debugging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all workflow events and decisions
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor workflow and step performance
- **Error Tracking**: Track and analyze workflow errors
- **Debugging Tools**: Provide tools for workflow debugging
