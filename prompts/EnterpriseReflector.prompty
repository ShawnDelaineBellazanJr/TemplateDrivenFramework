    public List<string> CodeSmells { get; set; }
    
    public QualityGrade CalculateGrade()
    {
        var score = 0;
        if (MaintainabilityIndex >= 65) score += 25;
        if (CyclomaticComplexity <= 10) score += 25;
        if (CodeCoverage >= 80) score += 25;
        if (TechnicalDebtHours <= 40) score += 25;
        
        return score switch
        {
            >= 90 => QualityGrade.Excellent,
            >= 80 => QualityGrade.Good,
            >= 70 => QualityGrade.Acceptable,
            _ => QualityGrade.NeedsImprovement
        };
